<h1>Welome to my Website</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Becoming a consultant began with a dream, then with a plan focused on how to become a consultant.  Though I briefly considered a career in a consulting company, my real passion was to build my own practice by becoming an independent counsel.  

    <p>1.1 Technology constantly changes the world around us.  It makes our everyday tasks easier and paves the way for many other options that I might have been missing out in life. Technology is the use of knowledge to create products and tools that help us in our lives. Innovation is the great road to success in this digital age. “The technology that has already proved itself in the past two decades is of course the information technology. It has dramatically changed the lives of the individuals and organizations. Currently online shopping, digital marketing, social networking, digital communication and cloud computing etc are the best examples of change which came through the wave of information technology. Now accurate business planning, effective marketing, global sales, systematic management, real time monitoring, instant customer support and long-term business growth cannot be achieved at the optimum level without IT.” https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-information-technology-business-success-abid-afzal-butt .  

        Information technology stands out as the soul of every business irrespective of how big or small the business is. Having information technology in business ensures the stay of the business in the modern competitive market.  
        
        Professor Henderson describes the unprecedented material progress that has occurred in the last century as a result of the wide-ranging entrepreneurial opportunities and competitive pressures that exist within a market economy. The material prosperity created by the activities of business is threatened by the ‘global salvationist consensus’ that has arisen in recent years and which seeks to change the role of business via the doctrine of corporate social responsibility. Professor Henderson shows that this consensus is based upon a set of fallacious beliefs about the nature of capitalism, profiteering and business enterprise.

         <p>1.2 As a foundation user, I plan and review the use of predefined or commonly used IT tools for activities that are straightforward. While reviewing my work, I will be able to identify and use automated methods or alternative ways of working to improve productivity. Any aspect that is unfamiliar will need support and advice from other people. </p>
        
       <p> 1.3 Trello is a great tool for project management and task management. The visual Kanban boards are flexible, shareable, and let you pack a ton of detail into each card. But Trello isn't just for work. You can use it to organize just about anything. Trello will help keep my work organized. Below is a link of my current Trello board. </p>

        <p>1.4 Project failure can happen due to various reasons. “Project failure can happen in any organization and to any project. There are an infinite number of reasons for failure. Sometimes it’s out of the control of a project manager and/or the team members. Sometimes failure is controllable. Failed projects and people involved with the failure have some things in common. In both cases they are given prescriptions for “quick fixes” which typically prove to be ineffective and can sometimes produce disastrous side effects.” </p>
        
        Some reasons have been outlined in by Risk Management, Sustainability 2007 Discenza, Richard and Forman, James B.

        1.5 Technology is a tool that helps you do what you do best, faster, or more efficiently. The key to choosing the right technology for your business is to understand what you are already doing well, and what you need to do better. 
        
        It is important to separate which tech will help in the growth of your business from those that will ultimately wind up being just another toy in the toolbox. You want to make choices that let you focus on your core business, not on the technology that helps operate it.

      <p> 1.6 Trello boards, lists, and cards enables me to organize and prioritize my projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way. Whether it’s for work, a side project or even the next family vacation, Trello helps me stay organized. It enables me dive into the details by adding comments, attachments, due dates, and more directly to Trello cards. The first thing I did was set up some lists on my Trello board. I organized, planned and prepared my work by prioritizing tasks and color-coding tasks that are done, outstanding. </p>
        
        GitHub is a tool which stores a copy of your project's repository just like any other developer. Then, you basically designate that as the project's central repository and all the developers push and pull their changes to and from that repository. GitHub takes this a step further by encouraging developers to fork a project's repository and then use that as their own centralized repository. From there they can send "pull requests" to the main project with their changes and then the project maintainers can review them before deciding whether to include them in their project or not. </p>
        
         
        
       <p> 1.7 We send e-mails, we share documents, we pay bills and we buy merchandise by entering our personal details all online and without a second thought. Have you ever stopped to wonder how much personal information you've shared online? Or what happens to this information? 
        
        We’re talking about banking information, contacts, addresses, social media postings, and even your IP address and the sites that you’ve visited are all stored digitally. 
        
        Companies tell you that they gather this kind of information so that they can serve you better, offer you more focused and relevant communications, all to provide you with a better customer experience. How are we sure these companies use the information the way they say they will? 
        
        This is the question that has been asked and answered by the EU, and why in May 2018 a new European privacy regulation called GDPR was enforced and permanently changed the way you, as a business, gather, store and use customer data. 
        
        In a study of more than 800 IT and business professionals that are responsible for data privacy at companies with European customers, Dell and Dimension Research found that 80% of businesses know few details or nothing about GDPR. 
        
        Recently, TrustArc found that only 20% of businesses believe they are now GDPR compliant. </p>
        
         
        
    <p>This new data protection regulation puts the consumer in the driver’s seat, and the task of complying with this regulation falls upon businesses and organizations. Otherwise, you fail to comply. 
        
        What falls within GDPR compliance? 
    
        GDPR applies to all businesses and organizations established in the EU, regardless of whether the data processing takes place in the EU or not. Even non-EU organizations will be subject to GDPR. If your company provides goods and/or services to EU citizens, then it is subject to GDPR. 
    
        There are tough penalties for those companies and organizations who don’t comply with GDPR fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. 
        
        How seriously is the EU taking GDPR? 
        
        For example, both British Airways and Marriott International are facing eye-watering fines that amount to hundreds of millions or euros for failing to comply. 
        
        British Airways are facing fines of up to €200 million for a data breach that occurred in September 2018 
        
        Marriott International are expected to be fined in the region of €99 million for a data breach between 2014 and 2018 
        
        Now, a lot of people might think that the GDPR is just an IT issue, but that is the farthest away from the truth. It has broad implications for the whole company, including the way companies deal with marketing and sales activities. </p>


        <p>1.1 Homepage: The homepage of my website is probably the most important feature of the website. It will guide visitors to the websites by showing what the website is all about. Detailed information of how to navigate the website will be on the homepage. Visitors would easily spot what they are looking instantly. 

Navigation bar: The navigation bar would be a road map to the interior of my Website. Each menu item will serve as a jumping point to the various pages that can help visitors learn more and convert. The menu will be kept simple so as not to confuse visitors with extraneous menu headings. 

Above the Fold: The best site layouts provide critical information with very little visitor input.All vital information will be above the fold so that it is front and center on visitors’ screens as soon as you land. For example, many websites, such as the examples above, use the formula Headline, Subhead, Copy and Image.All this information will potentially tempt visitors to read, learn, and click, thus converting almost instantly on landing.

1<p>.5 Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect sites because it may limit what you are able to publish. The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site. You may only copy, modify, distribute, or perform/display works that are entirely your own original work, which are in the public domain, or for which you have an exemption in the law or permit. 

“It is important to note that the internet is developing faster than the laws that attempt to govern it. For this reason, it is important for you to understand copyright laws before you build your company’s website. Many people assume that material on the internet is not covered by copyright laws, but this material is covered by the same laws that govern written material. In previous years, if an author or content creator wanted to copyright his or her material, the individual faced the formalities of registration and copyright notice." 

“In short, it is best to avoid using another website’s material. If you do, you will more than likely be notified by the creator, and a request will be made for you to remove the material. If you still refuse to remove the material, the owner or creator of the content will probably take legal action. This can be devastating for a business owner, and if you are found guilty of copyright infringement, you may be ordered to pay enormous sums of money. This prospect may seem intimidating at first, but by taking the time to create your own unique content, you can prevent this from happening to you.”

<p>1.6” Right out of the gate, I would want to know if you have done anything to ensure ADA accessibility on your website. More specifically, I would want to know how bad the problem is, and how easy it is to fix. A web accessibility audit report is a crucial document that can be used to identify low hanging fruit for a quick fix. Similarly, it can be used as a tool to uncover major accessibility problems that require intensive remediation efforts. "Web Accessibility and the Law Interview: 
Christian Antkowiak, a shareholder at Buchanan Ingersoll Rooney 

Navigation is probably the most important accessibility issue and applies to any website. Whether people have a disability or not, if a site has not been properly designed to allow for simple navigation, some of the website’s information will be difficult to access. 

Tab-through order: For people with disabilities, it’s extremely important that sites can be navigated using only a keyboard. This often means that the “tab” key is used to move through different sections within a webpage. Accessible websites should be structured so that pressing “tab” logically moves the user from the address bar to menus, across form fields and links, and to any other content areas in a clear and easy-to-follow manner. This let users who rely on keyboard navigation to move through a page in an intuitive way even if they can’t see the screen. 

Landmarks.: Just as physical landmarks help people navigate in real space, landmarks in a website help user navigate a page. These digital landmarks are special labels included in the site code that provide navigation indicators. Landmarks will, for example, allow screen readers to identify and communicate with the page’s navigation menu so that users can access that menu quickly without having to listen to all the text on a page. 

Size: Users should be able to easily increase or decrease text size. Text should also be able to be effectively displayed across a range of device types including desktop, mobile, and tablet. 

Contrast: Proper color contrast between text and backgrounds reduces challenges created by color blindness or other vision impairment conditions. WCAG 2.0 has clear guidelines on contrast levels for a range of text sizes. 

Color:  Colors should not be used to convey meaning. If developers wish to use colors to communicate something meaningful, alternative options should also be provided to communicate the meaning. This applies to features such as highlighted text. 

Videos: For people in the deaf community or for those hard of hearing, captioning and transcripts can provide synchronized text when viewing a video or a transcript text file that can be read separately. Modern software has allowed the captioning process to be done automatically as well as being able to identify other non-verbal information by identifying when music or laughter occurs on screen. 

Audio: Text versions of any audio files should be made available. 

Animations: Some people with cognitive disabilities find animations or other on- screen movement to be excessively distracting. This being the case, all site animations should include an option to disable or pause them.

<p>1.7 .jpg – "jay peg", great for web sites and email, this file format compresses continuous-tone images (like a picture with millions of colors) down to a size that can be downloaded of the Internet quickly. The downside to this format is that compressing the image too much will cause it to visibly degrade and look jagged. 

.gif – "gifs", pronounced with a "G", not a "J", also a terrific file type for the Internet and emailing. Gifs do an incredible job of compressing images and making them suitable for fast downloads. In contrast to the .jpg, the .gif is not suited for non-continuous color images, but solid colored images (some cartoons or clip art is a good example of this). One added bonus is that the .gif images can be placed on a web page with an clear background, so you layer them on a web page. Sometimes the artwork has a sharp, unattractive border when the image's background invisible, when this happens, go with the next file type, the .png. 

.png – "pings" or "p.n.g's:, this format can act as a hybrid between the .jpg and the .gif, it allows users to compress either non/continuous-tone color images, and allow you to put the on a web page with a clear background. .Pngs are usually larger in file size than the previous file formats but they allow people to save artwork to be layered on web pages or other artwork without any sharp or disruptive border. .Pngs are extremely versatile, but they usually result in larger files and longer download times. 

.eps – "encapsulated postScript", these files can be vector or raster - which makes them extremely powerful, this goes beyond the scope of this article. Professional printers and printable advertising media, like a magazine, will typically ask that the artwork be saved as an .eps file or perhaps a .tif. Recently the .pdf document has made some headway into certain areas of printed media as well. 

.tif – "tagged image file format", a versatile color space file format (CMYK, RGB, Grayscale) and cross-platform between Mac and PC. The .tif file format was originally intended for scanning, and a lot of scanned images are saved as tifs. Printers and advertisers will often request or permit final artwork to be designed in a tif. 

.pdf – "portable document format", Adobe's native file format that is read by a program called Adobe Acrobat. Most computer users have Acrobat on their system, if they don't, they can download Acrobat Reader for free. The .pdf has a wide range of uses, including a lot of usage on web, interactive forms and they can even be used for printing.
